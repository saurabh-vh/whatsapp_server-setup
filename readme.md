### Step 1: Requirements for Setting Up Your Server

1. **Server Environment**:
   - You need a Linux-based server (Ubuntu is recommended) for this setup. You can use cloud providers like **AWS**, **Google Cloud**, or **DigitalOcean** to set up your server.
   - Ensure that you have **root access** or **sudo access** to the server.

2. **WhatsApp Business API Client**:
   - Meta’s WhatsApp Business API Client is the core of this process. You'll be using it to interact with WhatsApp.
   - A **phone number** (with a dedicated SIM card) for WhatsApp Business is needed.

3. **Docker**:
   - WhatsApp Business API Client runs in a **Docker container**. Docker simplifies deployment and ensures consistency in your environment.

### Step 2: Set Up the Server

1. **Provision a Server**:
   - If you're using a cloud provider, create a new Ubuntu server instance. For example, on **AWS EC2**:
     - Select an **Ubuntu** instance (preferably 20.04 LTS or later).
     - Ensure the instance has at least **2 GB of RAM** and **30 GB of disk space** for smooth operation.
     - Allow **ports 443 (HTTPS)** and **80 (HTTP)** for inbound connections in the security group settings.

2. **Install Docker**:
   - SSH into your server and install Docker:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install -y docker.io
     sudo systemctl enable docker
     sudo systemctl start docker
     ```

3. **Install Docker Compose** (to manage multi-container applications):
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y docker-compose
   ```

### Step 3: Download and Install the WhatsApp Business API Client

1. **Clone WhatsApp Business API Client Repository**:
   - Use **Docker** to run the WhatsApp API client.
   - First, pull the Docker image for the WhatsApp Business API Client:
     ```bash
     docker pull whatsapp/business-api
     ```

2. **Configure the API Client**:
   - After the image is pulled, you’ll need to configure the environment variables and settings.
   - Create a configuration file for your WhatsApp Business API client. Typically, you’ll create a file like `docker-compose.yml` to define the services.
   - You’ll need to define things like the database credentials, API settings, and authentication for the phone number you’re registering with WhatsApp.

3. **Start the API Client**:
   - Run the container with Docker:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d
     ```

   - This command will start the WhatsApp Business API client in the background.

### Step 4: Set Up and Verify Your Phone Number

1. **Register the Phone Number**:
   - Once the client is running, you can use the `POST /v1/account` API to register your phone number. This will initiate the verification process.

2. **Verify the Phone Number**:
   - You'll be asked to provide a verification code sent via **SMS** or **Voice** call. Complete the process by sending the code to the server via the API.

---

### Step 5: Set Up API Access and Start Sending Messages

1. **Access Your API**:
   - The WhatsApp API Client will provide you with a **REST API** endpoint to send messages, manage contacts, and more.
   - You'll typically access the API via `https://your-server-ip:443` or a custom domain if you have one.

2. **Send Test Messages**:
   - After the phone number is verified, you can start sending WhatsApp messages using the API.

   Example of sending a message via the API:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-server-ip:443/v1/messages \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "to": "recipient_number",
       "type": "text",
       "text": {
         "body": "Hello from WhatsApp Business API!"
       }
     }'
   ```

   Replace `<YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN>` with your API token, `your-server-ip` with your server’s IP or domain, and `recipient_number` with the phone number you are sending the message to.

### Step 6: Monitor and Maintain Your Server

1. **Monitor API and Server Health**:
   - Regularly monitor the server’s health (CPU, memory, disk space) and the WhatsApp API Client’s logs.
   - Use tools like **Docker stats** to monitor container health.

2. **Update the API Client**:
   - Keep the WhatsApp Business API Client and Docker up to date to avoid security vulnerabilities.

### Alternative: Use a Cloud Provider’s Managed Service

If setting up your own server feels too complex, you might consider using a **cloud-based WhatsApp Business API provider** like **Twilio**, **360dialog**, or **Vonage**. These providers offer managed services where they handle all the backend setup for you, so you can focus on integration.
